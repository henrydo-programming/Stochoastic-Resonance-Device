// This is the arduino code for the stochastic resonance device. It utilizes a C2 Tactor from Engineering Accoustics.
// There are 4 versions of this code, differing only by frequency values.

// The setup() function is called when a sketch starts. Use it to initialize 
// variables, pin modes, start using libraries, etc. The setup() function will 
// only run once, after each powerup or reset of the Arduino board.
// The actions are performed in the functions "setup" and "loop"
// but no information is reported to the larger program when 'void' precedes it.
